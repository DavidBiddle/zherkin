# Zone Hackathon #1 - Zherkin

## Your Challenge
Use the BDD Gherkin files in `/Gherkin` and come up with *something* that can visualise these in some way for other stakeholders. Think a PO who wants to know "what was the test case again?" without them having access to `/Gherkin` in the repo.

You are encouraged to use a tech stack you ARE NOT familiar with or want to explore in a different way.

Some ideas of what could be interesting:
- Build a front-end that takes `/Gherkin` and presents it in a nice way
- Build a DevOps pipeline that automatically builds some front-end static site or executes a script that outputs statistics/details of `/Gherkin` somewhere
- Build a back-end that uses `/Gherkin` and exposes the tests (and/or stats) via an API
- None or all of the above. You are free to come up with anything else you find interesting ðŸ™‚

## Visual Inspiration
Feel free to use this as a guide for what it *could* look like, or don't if you had something else in mind.
